# Home and end in terminal
For home and end keys, bind some combination to send hex codes 0x01 and 0x05
Eg: Alt + left-arrow = 0x01
    Alt + right-arrow = 0x05

# History search forward and backward
Map some combination (possibly escape sequences) to history-search-backward
and history-search-forward in inputrc and map some combination to send
those sequences
Eg: In .inputrc,
        "\033u": history-search-backward # Esc + u
        "\033d": history-search-forward  # Esc + d
    Then add these mappings,
    Alt + up-arrow = Esc + u
    Alt + down-arrow = Esc + d
